[list]
    [*] Removed @ap_technological_ascendancy_rare_tech, which allows all the techs to be drawn again.

    [*] Replaced usings of jobs/pw/politician_add inline script with jobs/politician_add inline script. 
    [*] Changed district_XXX_max modifier to district_XXX_max_add. 
    [*] Fixed pw_jobs_any_research scripted trigger.
    [*] Integrated job_duelist_add into job_entertainer_add. Opened job is a mock, so nobody can take it. 
    [*] Integrated job_culture_worker_add, job_preacher_add and job_haruspex_add into job_bureaucrat_add. Opened jobs are mocks, so nobody can take it. 
    [*] Integrated job_bath_attendant_add into job_healthcare_add. Opened job is a mock, so nobody can take it. 
    [*] Integrated job_bath_attendant_hive_add into job_spawning_drone_add. Opened job is a mock, so nobody can take it.

    [*] Disabled job_maintenance_drone_add and job_maintenance_drone_per_pop. This job is not capped by job slots, so these modifier isn't required.

[h1]Version 1.7.0 (for Stellaris 4.0.*)[/h1]
[h2]Update by AdmirableOstrich[/h2]
[list]
    [*]Batch changes for all the simple 3.14 -> 4.0.x modding changes: e.g. pops get 100x, amenities get 20x, changes to pop_growth mults, etc.
    [*]Added inlines, triggers, effects to simplify some repeated code (also fixed a few bugs hidden amongst the duplication)
    [*]All buildings now have building sets (4.0 requirement)
    [*]Added the triggered code implementation from the possibly-no-longer Merger and wrapped giga and stellaris evolved dependencies so they don't throw a bunch of errors on game start. Both (whenever stellaris evolved gets updated) should now be natively supported.
    [*]Vanquished the error log. Barring future Stellaris changes or other mods changing the vanilla files, there are no remaining error messages.
    [*]Fixed an issue where the empire/sector unique check was failing. This was caused by the count_owned_planet trigger not functioning with count=all. If it every behaved as intended it isn't anymore. Fortunately, any_owned_planet works fine which is basically the same check just inverted.

[*] Synthetic Fertility Origin is treated as having Synthetic Evolution AP, because it unlocks Synthetic tradition and block Ascention Paths.
[*] Individualst machine main species is treated as having Synthetic Evolution AP, because they are Synthetic already and can't take Synthetic Evolution AP.
[*] The Flesh is Weak AP (or Cybernetic Creed Origin) job is replaced from Medical Worker to Augmentor (Stellaris 3.13 new job).
[*] Fixed issue #14 (Tier 2 and 3 Living Spire don't have entertainer or duelist job (only job desc) some time).
